# Computer-Networks-Topology-Cisco-Pkt-Tracer
In this project I designed and simulated the full working of a network Topology using OSPF, Redistribution, EIGRP, etc.


1. All hosts in EIGRP, OSPF areas 1, 2, and RIP will get IP addresses from the "DHCP Server" present in
the last block at the bottom.
2. You have to use VLSM in each network of the topology. Remember that between two routers you need a
total of 4 ip addresses. And information about host requirements of all other networks is provided in the
attached file as mentioned above.
3. You have to IMPLEMENT NAT in Router6 with the Network A. Use the Private IP Address given to
you in the attached file for Natting.
4. One of the PCs of Network A will not be allowed to access the web server. All hosts connected in
network D will not be allowed to access "Web Server".
5. There is a “mail server” in the first block. All the hosts in the first block will have email configured and
can send email to each other.
